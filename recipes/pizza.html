        <h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>
        <p>To make a classic pizza, start by preparing the dough from flour, yeast, water, salt, and olive oil, letting it rise until doubled in size. Roll out the dough into a round shape and spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the surface. Add a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese, and then top with your favorite ingredients such as pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, and olives. Bake in a preheated oven at 475°F (245°C) for about 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly. Finish with a sprinkle of fresh basil and a drizzle of olive oil before serving.</p>
